## üí¨ How to prevent emails going to spam folder?

After the receiver's ISP accpets the email, the ISP decides wheater the email is categorized as span and determines the overall mailbox placement.

There are several factors that can lead to an ISP flagging an email as span, such as:

- The email content and quality: insecure links, links considered harmful, specific keywords, links to domains that aren't the sending domain

- DKIM or SPF authentication not provided

- IP address reputation

- Multiple emails flagged as spam will put your domain's email into the *sandbox*

- High bounce or complaint rates

> Setting Up Easy DKIM for a AWS SES domain available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-authentication-dkim-easy-setup-domain.html).
